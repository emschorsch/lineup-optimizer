# lineup-optimizer

Project for m53 - Stochastic Modeling
Authors: Emanuel Schorsch and Alexander Valera.

The project calculates expected runs scored for a given lineup. It calculates this using a simplified model that ignores baserunning, opposing pitchers, steals, fatigue etc.

The code for calcuting run expectancy was initially ported from Joel Sokol's Matlab run expectancy calculator. That code was provided as an accompaniement to his paper "An Intuitive Markov Chain Lesson From Baseball" (Sokol, Informs Transactions on Education 2004).
